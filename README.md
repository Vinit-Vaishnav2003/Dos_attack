# Dos_attack
Hello, everyone!
I'm excited to share that I recently delved into the field of cybersecurity.
In my exploration, I decided to experiment with a well-known server attack called DDoS using Slowloris.


Sure! Here's a revised version of your content with corrections and vocabulary enhancements:

*How to Use:
The tools I utilized are Kali Linux, Slowloris code, and Locust (used to assess server performance).
Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open the terminal in Kali Linux.
2. Run the Slowloris code by entering the command and providing the IP address of your server as input.
   - Ensure that your server is hosted on Google or running on localhost on your machine.

*How to Obtain the Server IP:
To retrieve the server IP, use the following command:
```
$ host www.google.com
```

Please note that engaging in any unauthorized activities, including conducting DDoS attacks, is illegal and unethical.
